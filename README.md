### Hi, I'm Ani ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I love startups and functional programming. I'm most fulfilled by working on things I find interesting, continually expanding my knowledge, and spending time with the meaningful relationships I have in my life.

- I bias toward statically typed languages that encourage functional programming paradigms. I also bias toward SQL over other database stores. Ultimately though, I will try to learn the best tool for the job (which surprisingly often, tends to be the aforementioned things).

Engineering is one way I express my thoughts into tangible things, but it doesn't define my humanity.
