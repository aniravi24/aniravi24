Iâ€™m fascinated by statically-typed languages that encourage functional programming paradigms, such as Haskell.

I also love solutions that can reach a wider audience. For example, I believe [effect-ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS) is the most important underrated set of libraries within the TypeScript ecosystem.

Computers were built to aid us - naturally, they should help us build better programs. I care about building robust, maintainable software, and am motivated by hard problems, not building the next cool widget.
